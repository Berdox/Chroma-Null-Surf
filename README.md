# Chroma-Null-Surf
A custom surf map made for titanfall 2

---

## How to Launch the Map Locally

1. Launch **Northstar** and enter the **Multiplayer Lobby**.
2. Open the in-game console by pressing the `~` (tilde) key.
3. Type the following command into the console and press Enter:

   ```
   mp_chroma_null_surf
   ```

It will launch the map in the surf game mode with settings I have set for the game mode.

⚠️ If you launch the map in a game mode except surf, **it will crash the map.**

## Know bugs
- If you load the map with **Sun Shadow Detail** not disable, it will mess with lighting and shadows.
  You just need to change **Sun Shadow Detail** to anything else and apply the change and it will
  fix the bug.
